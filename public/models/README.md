# Face-API.js Models

This directory should contain the face-api.js models required for face recognition to work.

For the face recognition feature to work properly, please download the following model files from the face-api.js GitHub repository and place them in this directory:

1. tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json
2. tiny_face_detector_model-shard1
3. face_landmark_68_model-weights_manifest.json
4. face_landmark_68_model-shard1
5. face_recognition_model-weights_manifest.json
6. face_recognition_model-shard1

These can be downloaded from: https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/tree/master/weights

Note: In a production environment, these models would be properly hosted and distributed with the application.
